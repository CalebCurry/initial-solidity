[Lottery system](https://github.com/CalebCurry/initial-solidity/blob/main/projects/lottery.sol):
This will take .1 eth from many addresses until the owner chooses a winner at random. This covers many concepts including state variables, dynamic arrays, addresses and payable addresses, working with the contract constructor, receiving funds, checking values with require, pseudo-random numbers, sending eth to winners, and resetting the contract.
